# Wipro_Photo_Gallery

### Technologies used:
1. Android Studio
2. Kotlin
3. XML

### Assignment Description:
The application displays a set of photos one by one.

The App has to be developed to show a static set of pictures which is already copied into the drawable folder in the Android 
application project.

The User Interface should consist of 2 buttons *next, previous*, 1 *Toggle Button* to enable/disable the slideshow mechanism
and an Image View to show the picture. The *Next button* should show the next picture in the list, and once it reaches the end of the list, 
it should start showing the first picture. The *Previous button* should show the previous picture in the list and once it reached the beginning of the list, it should start showing the last picture. The *Toggle Button* is for supporting the slideshow support for automatically showing the next picture after every “n” seconds. If the state of the *Toggle Button* is on, then the auto mode should be on.
