### Technologies Used:

### Assessment Description:
The application displays a set of photos one by one.

The App has to be developed to show a static set of pictures which is already copied into the drawable folder in the Android 
application project.

The User Interface should consist of 2 buttons [next, previous], 1 Toggle Button to enable/disable the slideshow mechanism
and an Image View to show the picture. Next button should show the next picture in the list, and once it reaches the end of the list, 
it should start showing the first picture. Previous button should show the previous picture in the list and once it reached the beginning 
of the list, it should start showing the last picture. ToggleButton is for supporting the slideshow support for automatically showing 
the next picture after every “n” seconds. If the state of the ToggleButton is on, then the auto mode should be on.
